Depth verification
        
1. Visual inspection: You can visually inspect the generated image and its depth distribution to see if it aligns with the input depth map in terms of object shapes and relative distances.
2. Perceptual metrics (limited): Some perceptual metrics like Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) or Peak Signal-to-Noise

Code Execution and Analysis
Execution:

The code iterates through each prompt and corresponding depth map:

Loads prompts from the specified Word document.
Loads depth images from the specified directory, handling both PNG and NumPy formats.
Preprocesses depth images: Converts them to grayscale tensors and normalizes them.
Generates images: Uses the generate_image function to create images based on prompts and depth maps, employing ControlNet for conditioning.
Saves images: Saves the generated images with unique filenames.
Thought Process:

The code aims to effectively utilize Stable Diffusion with ControlNet to generate images guided by depth maps. Key considerations include:

Consistent pipeline: The code maintains a consistent pipeline for all images, ensuring consistent behavior.
Depth map handling: It handles both PNG and NumPy formats for flexibility.
Preprocessing: Normalization of depth maps is crucial for compatibility with the model.
ControlNet integration: The code effectively integrates ControlNet for depth-guided image generation.
Visual Results:

The quality of generated images will depend on factors like prompt clarity, depth map accuracy, and model parameters. Visual inspection is essential to assess the effectiveness of the approach.

Areas of Success:

Depth-guided generation: The code successfully leverages ControlNet to incorporate depth information into image generation, leading to more realistic and controlled results.
Consistent execution: The pipeline consistently processes all images, ensuring uniformity in output.
Flexibility: The code handles both PNG and NumPy depth maps, accommodating different data formats.
Areas of Improvement:

Depth verification: A more robust depth verification mechanism could be implemented, possibly using quantitative metrics like SSIM or PSNR.
Hyperparameter tuning: Experimenting with different hyperparameters (e.g., guidance scale, noise schedule) could further enhance image quality.
ControlNet techniques: Exploring additional ControlNet conditioning techniques (e.g., normal maps, canny edges) might yield even more diverse results.
Error handling: Implementing more comprehensive error handling could improve robustness.
Fixing Potential Issues:

Depth map inconsistencies: If depth maps are inaccurate or noisy, it can affect image quality. Consider refining depth data or using techniques like depth map denoising.
Prompt ambiguity: Ambiguous or contradictory prompts can lead to unexpected results. Refining prompt engineering techniques can improve image quality.
Model limitations: The limitations of the Stable Diffusion model itself can affect image generation quality. Exploring alternative models or fine-tuning might be beneficial.
